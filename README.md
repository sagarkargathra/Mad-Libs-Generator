# Mad-Libs-Generator
Enter in the words and a story will be written for you.

Interactive display of a mad lib, which is provided as a Python format string,
with all the cues being dictionary formats, in the form {cue}.

In this version, the cues are extracted from the story automatically,
and the user is prompted for the replacements.

Original verison adapted from code of Kirby Urner
